<p>
While working for different software houses, in more than one occasion I had the chance to work on an application which is mainly based on I/O File operations.
</p>

<p>
The biggest challenge the team was facing while working on such kind of applications is that the I/O File operations are so hard to be covered by unit tests, automate Bamboo builds, and many other things.
</p>

<p>
Therefore, once and for all, I decided to come up with the best design I can come up with to overcome these challenges. However, just as a reminder, nothing in software is an absolute truth. For every application you have to reconsider your design, see where it fits, where it doesn’t fit, and finally you need to adapt.
</p>

<p>
Now, as usual, I am going to provide a simple example and walk you through the trip to come up with the best -possible- solution.
